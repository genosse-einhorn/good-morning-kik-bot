# "Good Morning!" Kik bot

a bot that will text you "Good Morning!" every day on kik

## Origin and Purpose

**B**: Why do you text these creepy foreign guys you'll never see again?

**A**: You know, I kind of like waking up to a text like "Good morning my angel"

**C**: If it's all about that text, then I guess I could do that too

**me**: We could write a bot for that

## How to run

*   Fill `config.json` with kik data
*   Run `index.js`
    * By default, the bot will open port 8080 and make itself accessible via ngrok
    * If you want to change this, set the `PORT` and `URL` environment variables
*   Text the bot! As soon as it receives a message from you, you will be remembered
    and greeted the next morning, between 7 and 8 a.m. Europe/Berlin time
